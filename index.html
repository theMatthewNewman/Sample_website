	<h1>The learn enough story</h1>

	<p>
	  Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
	  <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
	  command of your computer and get it to <b>do your bidding. </b> This includes
	  everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
	  Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
	  We belive there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benifit from
	  learning <em>technical sophistication</em>, proabably more. To join our

	  <h3>Michael Harti</h3>

	  <p>
		Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org">
	    Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principle author of the
		<a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
		introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
		<a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
		plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secetly a supervillan
		are slightly exaggerated.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Lee Donahue</h3>
	  <p>
		When he is not litterally swimming with sharks od hunting powder stashes
		on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
		interfaces, doing front-end development, or writting some of the
		inrerface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
	  </p>
	<h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
	<p>
	  You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
